                    I am a mechanical engineer and an applied mathematician interested in basic and applied research questions arising 
                    in the calculus of variation, solid mechanics, biophysics, and numerical methods, particularly focused on mechanics-driven constrained optimization.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                  As a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Biomechanical Engineering, TU Delft, 
                    I'm applying my expertise in mechanics and computational methods to develop personalized
                    healthcare and rehabilitation solutions. My current research focuses on vision-based biomechanics
                    and mesh registration techniques to create highly accurate, personalized musculoskeletal models that
                    can transform rehabilitation practices.

                Previously, during my  postdoc with <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/mmmu/eliot-fried/" target="_blank">Prof. Eliot Fried</a> in <a
                    href="https://groups.oist.jp/mmmu" target="_blank">Mechanics and Materials Unit</a> at <a
                    href="https://www.oist.jp/" target="_blank">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)</a>,, 
                    we explored the folding and mobility of unstretchable surfaces for deployable structures. 
                    In particular, we worked on constructing M&ouml;bius and orientable bands from unstretchable helicoids. 
                    We  also worked on finding the rheological properties of energy-minimization-driven shapes of virus particles. 
                    My work utilized a blend of variational calculus, differential geometry, and computational modeling tools like 
                    MATLAB, Python, and C++. Please see the full <a href="files/CV_Vikash_2024.pdf">CV</a> current through 8/2023.      <br>

                    I am enthusiastic about creating photorealistic images and animations of optimized shapes,
                    accomplished through the synergy of Python and Blender. Additionally, I develop web-based
                    interactive visualizations, recognizing the value of effective visualization tools in enhancing
                    the understanding of our results and their
                    applications in shape optimization. Please see the <a href="./interactive_visualization">interactive visualization</a> and <a href="./gallery"> gallery </a> for some of my works.

This framework was inspired by reverse cholesterol transport, wherein the high-density lipoproteins (HDL) particles constituted by charged Apo-lipoproteins attached to a spherical core are responsible for maintaining the cholesterol level in the human body. Additionally, we worked on the effect of surface tension imbalance on arbitrarily shaped floating bodies, unraveling the mechanism utilized by water-walking insects such as Rove beetles.

                        <p class="notice--info"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> We consider the problem of producing a ruled
                            M&ouml;bius band by subjecting an unstretchable material surface in a circular helicoidal
                            reference configuration to a deformation that is isometric and chirality preserving. We find
                            that such a M&ouml;bius band is completely determined by the unit binormal of the Frenet frame of
                            its midline, which must be a geodesic and must have constant torsion inversely proportional
                            to the pitch of the helicoidal reference configuration.

                            For a material surface that is characterized by an energy density which depends
                            quadratically on the mean curvature of its deformed configuration, we show that the total
                            energy stored in producing a M&ouml;bius band as described reduces to an integral over the
                            midline of the M&ouml;bius band.

                            We formulate and numerically solve a constrained variational problem for finding relative
                            minima of the dimensionally reduced bending energy and constructing corresponding stable
                            M&ouml;bius bands. The only input parameter entering our variational problem is the number
                            <i>&nu;</i> of turns of a referential helicoid. We do not obtain a solution to our problem
                            unless <i>&nu;</i> exceeds a certain threshold, which we compute to machine precision.

                            Above that threshold, an interplay between the operative constraint leads to a multiplicity
                            of coexisting stable solutions with <i>n &ge; 3</i> half twists. For each <i>n &ge; 3</i>,
                            we construct an energetically optimal M&ouml;bius band which exhibits <i>n</i>-fold rotational
                            symmetry. All other energy minima yield M&ouml;bius bands with broken symmetry.

                            context of simple structures like spheres and cylinders, takes a leap forward in this study,
                            which extends the concept to more complex geometries. We introduce a novel method for the
                            continuous, isometric, and iso-energetic eversion of M&ouml;bius and orientable binormal
                            scrolls with midlines of uniform torsion. Our approach, rooted in a kinematically consistent
                            time-evolution equation, ensures a seamless transformation that preserves both geometry and
                            energy throughout the eversion process. This methodology marks a notable advancement from
                            previous studies that limited their focus to the initial and final states of eversion. By
                            capturing the intermediate stages, our research provides a comprehensive understanding of
                            the eversion dynamics in these intricate structures. The analytical solution derived here
                            not only offers a closed-form expression for the everting motion but also paves the way for
                            practical applications. These include the development of adaptive materials and soft robotic
                            systems with dynamically tunable properties, as well as innovations in medical, aerospace,
                            and architectural engineering. Bridging theoretical concepts with real-world applications,

                        High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, crucial for transporting cholesterol to the liver, comprise a spherical core with charged Apo-I and Apo-II protein loops attached to its surface. These proteins' shapes are vital for HDL functionality. My Ph.D. research studied the equilibrium shapes of charged, elastic curves confined to spherical surfaces. I explored the balance between elastic energy, favoring circular shapes, and electrostatic repulsion, pushing these curves apart. This interplay leads to complex equilibrium shapes in the proteins, offering insights into the structural principles of HDL particles.

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                            A variational approach is used to study the behavior of two closed, inextensible,
                            interacting elastic loops that are constrained to lie on a sphere. In addition to the
                            bending energy of each loop, the total potential energy of the system includes nonlocal
                            contributions that account for intraloop and interloop interactions. Euler--Lagrange
                            equations and energy based stability condition are derived in a coordinate-free setting
                            using the first and second variation of the potential energy functional. As an illustrative
                            application, a problem in which all the interaction potentials are Coulombic and both loops
                            possess the same length, bending rigidity, and positive charge density is considered.

                            To ensure existence of a trivial solution in which the loops are parallel and circular, the
                            length of the loops are taken to be smaller than perimeter of the great circle of the
                            sphere. Detailed bifurcation and linear stability analyses of the trivial solution are
                            conducted. The stability of the trivial solution is governed by three dimensionless
                            parameters <em>a</em>, <em>&zeta;</em>, and <em>&chi;</em>, where <em>a</em> is the ratio
                            between the radius of the loops to radius of the sphere and where <em>&zeta;</em> and
                            <em>&chi;</em> encompass information about the ratio of intraloop interaction and interloop
                            interaction to the bending rigidity.

                            While the bending energy and the intraloop interaction energy stabilize the trivial
                            solution, the interloop interaction has a destabilizing influence. Moreover, a cross-over
                            phenomenon associated with the nature of the most destabilizing mode is discovered: for
                            <em>0 &lt; a &lt; a<sub>c</sub></em>, the number of modes represented in the most
                            destabilizing modes varies with <em>&zeta;</em> and <em>&chi;</em>; for <em>a<sub>c</sub>
                                &lt; a &lt; 1</em>, the most destabilizing mode is always the lowest mode in keeping
                            with results for problems involving only bending energy.

                        Our research focuses on understanding the rheological properties of viruses, mainly how their shapes influence behavior and interactions in the human body. We use energy minimization techniques to determine viral shapes and their rheological properties. This approach has yielded insights into the functionality and hydrodynamic behavior of viruses. Notably, our work on COVID-19 has shown the significant impact of spike protein geometry, core shape, and charge distribution on its rheological properties, underscoring the importance of spike proteins in viral behavior. Looking ahead, we aim to extend our research to a broader range of viruses. Our published articles on this topic can be found below.

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in viral hydrodynamics afford the calculation of the transport properties of particle suspensions from first principles, namely, from the detailed particle shapes. For coronavirus suspensions, for example, the shape can be approximated by beading (i) the spherical capsid and (ii) the radially protruding peplomers. General rigid bead-rod theory allows us to assign Stokesian hydrodynamics to each bead. Thus, viral hydrodynamics yields the suspension rotational diffusivity, but not without first arriving at a configuration for the cationic peplomers. Prior work considered identical peplomers charged identically. However, a recent pioneering experiment uncovers remarkable peplomer size and charge heterogeneities. In this work, we use energy minimization to arrange the spikes, charged heterogeneously to obtain the coronavirus spike configuration required for its viral hydrodynamics. For this, we use the measured charge heterogeneity. We consider 20,000 randomly generated possibilities for cationic peplomers with formal charges ranging from 30 to 55. We find the configurations from energy minimization of all of these possibilities to be nearly spherically symmetric, all slightly oblate, and we report the corresponding breadth of the dimensionless rotational diffusivity, the transport property around which coronavirus cell attachment revolves.

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> The coronavirus is always idealized as a spherical capsid with radially protruding spikes. However, histologically, in the tissues of infected patients, capsids in cross section are elliptical, and only sometimes spherical [Neuman et al., “Supramolecular architecture of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus revealed by electron cryomicroscopy,” J Virol, 80, 7918 (2006)]. This capsid ellipticity implies that coronaviruses are oblate or prolate or both. We call this diversity of shapes, pleomorphism. Recently, the rotational diffusivity of the spherical coronavirus in suspension was calculated, from first principles, using general rigid bead-rod theory [Kanso et al., “Coronavirus rotational diffusivity,” Phys Fluids 32, 113101 (2020)]. We did so by beading the spherical capsid and then also by replacing each of its bulbous spikes with a single bead. In this paper, we use energy minimization for the spreading of the spikes, charged identically, over the oblate or prolate capsids. We use general rigid bead-rod theory to explore the role of such coronavirus cross-sectional ellipticity on its rotational diffusivity, the transport property around which its cell attachment revolves. We learn that coronavirus ellipticity drastically decreases its rotational diffusivity, be it oblate or prolate.

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, the rotational diffusivity of the coronavirus particle in suspension was calculated, from first principles, using general rigid bead-rod theory [M. A. Kanso, Phys. Fluids 32, 113101 (2020)]. We did so by beading the capsid and then also by replacing each of its bulbous spikes with a single bead. However, each coronavirus spike is a glycoprotein trimer, and each spike bulb is triangular. In this work, we replace each bulbous coronavirus spike with a bead triplet, where each bead of the triplet is charged identically. This paper, thus, explores the role of bulb triangularity on the rotational diffusivity, an effect not previously considered. We thus use energy minimization for the spreading of triangular bulbs over the spherical capsid. The latter both translates and twists the coronavirus spikes relative to one another, and we then next arrive at the rotational diffusivity of the coronavirus particle in suspension, from first principles. We learn that the triangularity of the coronavirus spike bulb decreases its rotational diffusivity. For a typical peplomer population of 74, bulb triangularity decreases the rotational diffusivity by 1/3.

                        <h2>Surface tension mediated shape changes</h2>
                        Surface tension, a critical interfacial phenomenon, significantly influences natural and engineered systems. Its role extends beyond shaping films and liquid interfaces; it is crucial in phenomena like Marangoni propulsion, observed in water-walking insects such as the rove beetle (Stenus comma). Our published articles on this topic can be found below.

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
                                We perform a static analysis of a circular cylinder that forms a barrier between surfactant-laden and surfactant-free portions of a liquid-gas interface. In addition to determining the general implications of the balances for forces and torques, we quantify how the imbalance &Delta;&gamma; = &gamma;<sub>a</sub> - &gamma;<sub>b</sub> between the uniform surface tension &gamma;<sub>a</sub> of the surfactant-free portion of the interface and the uniform surface tension &gamma;<sub>b</sub> of the surfactant-laden portion of the interface influences the load-bearing capacity of a hydrophobic cylinder.
                               
                                Moreover, we demonstrate that the difference between surface tensions on either side of a cylinder with a cross-section of arbitrary shape induces a horizontal force component f<sup>h</sup> equal to &Delta; &gamma; in magnitude, when measured per unit length of the cylinder. With an energetic argument, we show that this relation also applies to a rod-like barrier with cross-sections of variable shape. In addition, we apply our analysis to amphiphilic Janus cylinders and we discuss practical implications of our findings for Marangoni propulsion and surface pressure measurements.
